Mean Fare: 32.2

Survival Rate: ~38% survived

📈 Visualizations (Insert these images)
1. Age Distribution

🖼️ (Insert: age_distribution.png)
Most passengers are aged between 20–40 years, showing a young adult population.

2. Fare Distribution by Passenger Class

🖼️ (Insert: fare_boxplot.png)
Higher class passengers (1st class) paid significantly more fares and had higher survival chances.

3. Survival Count by Gender

🖼️ (Insert: survival_by_gender.png)
Females show a much higher survival rate than males — “Women and children first” effect is visible.

4. Correlation Heatmap

🖼️ (Insert: correlation_heatmap.png)
Survived is correlated with Sex, Pclass, and Fare, meaning these factors heavily influenced survival.

🧩 Key Observations

Most passengers are in their 20s and 30s.

Females survived at a much higher rate (~74%) than males (~19%).

1st class passengers were most likely to survive, while 3rd class had the lowest chance.

Children (under 10) also had higher survival rates.

Fare and class are strong indicators of survival.

Cabin data has many missing values and needs imputation or removal.

🧾 Summary of Findings

Overall Survival Rate: ~38%

Gender Impact: Females much more likely to survive

Class Impact: 1st class had best survival rate

Age Impact: Children more likely to survive

Fare Relationship: Higher fare = higher survival

Missing Data: Age and Cabin columns incomplete

Strong Predictors of Survival: Sex, Pclass, Fare

📘 Conclusion

The Titanic dataset shows clear social and economic patterns of survival:
Women, children, and wealthy passengers had higher chances of survival.
These findings are consistent with historical records and serve as a strong dataset for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model building.
